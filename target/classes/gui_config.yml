#✍✍✍✍ This file handles everything about the welcome gui if you have it enabled in the main plugin config.✍✍✍✍
#✍✍✍✍ You can change anything here to be whatever custom stuff you want.✍✍✍✍
#✍✍✍✍ The plugin will automatically parse any placeholder api placeholders you use such as %player_name% ✍✍✍✍


# Here you can set the title that appears in the gui.
# If you are using a custom resource pack such system such as Oraxen or Itemstadder you can put the placeholders here.
# You can also put the unicode for resource pack images in the title
# GENERAL EXAMPLE: ""&2Welcome &5%player_name% &2To the server""
# ORAXEN EXAMPLE: "&f%oraxen_neg_shift_64%%oraxen_star_subscriptions_gui%"
# ITEMSADDER EXAMPLE: ":offset_-16::subscriptions_menu:""
Gui-Title: "&f%oraxen_neg_shift_64%%oraxen_star_subscriptions_gui%"

# Here is where you can specify what items you want the border of the gui to be.
# If you don't want any items just put AIR
Gui-Border-Item: BEACON

# Should the players inventory get cleared when the gui opens?
# *NOTE* The player inventory gets put into memory and then given back the same tick the gui is closed
# *NOTE* Players will NOT lose items due to this, it's only to make the gui look cleaner for full screen overlays
